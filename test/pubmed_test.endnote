%X Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been included by European and American hypertension therapy guidelines as a common cause of high blood pressure. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong link between OSA and HBP and the treatment thereof should consist of combination therapy, especially in patients with refractory AHT and a non-dipping profile. We present the case of a patient with high grade hypertension, with secondary organ damage and severe OSA. The ultimate method for controlling blood pressure and reversing subclinical cardiac and cerebrovascular dysfunction of this patient was the specific therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (cPAP).

%X BACKGROUND: The main symptomatic criterion to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the level of daytime sleepiness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a simple, self-administered questionnaire which provides a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that can predict daytime sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea. METHODS: 50 consecutive patients with obstructive sleep apnea were enrolled into the study. Age, gender, anthropometric and polygraphic data were thoroughly analyzed. In all subjects daily sleepiness was assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 54.7 ± 12.8 years, 82% males. The mean BMI was 31.9 ± 6 kg/m2. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis demonstrates a significant positive correlation between the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the desaturation index (r = 0.31, p < 0.01) and arterial hypertension (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). The forward stepwise regression analysis shows that the apnea hypopnea index and desaturation index are important predictors of daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea which explains 40% of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. CONCLUSION: The desaturation index showed the strongest correlation with the Epworth scale. According to the results of the backward stepwise multiple regression and logistic regression, the predictors for the level of daytime sleepiness are oAHI and index of desaturation. According to the analysis of the ROC curve, desaturation index is a predictor of a high specificity.

%X The article covers prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, its role in health disorders of workers engaged into railway safety. The authors analyzed present standards of occupational fitness in workers performing critically important operating activities and methods of occupational selection with possible obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. I stage recommendations are suggested in diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in workers engaged into railway safety. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome appeared to threaten operators' activity, to cause accidents, to early disablement due to life-threatening complications, to unsuitability for the occupation due to diseases connected with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiac rhythm and conductivity disorders, obesity).

%X People in prison may experience barriers in accessing health services. By exploring some of these barriers and how they have been overcome, this article describes how prisoners were made aware of obstructive sleep apnoea and the associated risks, and how a clinic was set up in a prison healthcare centre. It shows how access to a community service was made available to the prisoners, and details how the service was set up, how it operates and what the outcomes achieved.

%X The primary etiopathology of pediatric OSAHS includes tonsil or adenoid hypertrophy. Severe OSAHS contributes to or aggravates thoracic deformity, which is rarely reported. In the current report, This children sleep snoring more than 4 years, increasing with thoracic severe depression during sleep 2 days. Clinical examination indicated tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy, and polysomnography revealed OSAHS . The symptoms of OSAHS and severe inhalation-related sternum depression disappeared rapidly after tonsillectomy. Our findings indicated that OSAHS were the major causes underlying funnel chest in children. The rarity of the incidence may result in missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Polysomnography was recommended for the child diagnosed with funnel chest accompanied by upper airway stenosis.

%X OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of pure adenoidectomy,adenoidectomy with partial tonsillectomy,and adenoidectomy with total tonsillectomy on humoral and cellular immunity of children with OSAHS. METHOD: The children with OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnography were divided into pure adenoidectomy group(group A),adenoidectomy with partial tonsillectomy group(group B), and adenoidectomy with total tonsillectomy(group C), and there were 50 cases in each group. The serum IgG, IgA, IgM level and peripheral blood T cell subgroup per-centage were detected at 6 months preoperatively and postoperatively. Tonsil grading and polysomnography wereconducted, recording symptoms improvement situation at postoperative 6 months. RESULT: There was no statisticallysignificant difference compared with preoperative(P>0. 05) in humoral immunity and cellular immunity index ofpostoperative 6 months. There was no significani difference(P>C. 05) in curative effect among three groups in the 6th month post-operatively. CONCLUSION: All of these three surgical procedures had no obvious effect on humoral orcellular immune function in children, and could effectively treat children OSAHS.

%X OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and plasma endothelium (ET) in pathophysiologic process of patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome(OSAHS) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHOD: All observed subjects were divided into 4 groups. A number of 80 patients with OSAHS, 65 cases of OSAHS with T2DM patients, 20 patients with T2DM, and 32 cases of healthy control group were observed in this study. The serum levels of TNF-α and ET were detected by double antibody sandwich ELISA, the content of TNF-α and ET were compared between OSAHS group and OSAHS + T2DM group. It were also compared before and after treatment of CPAP or surgery. RESULT: TNF-α level is higher in OSAHS+T2DM group than that in the OSAHS group, T2DM group and the control group (P < 0.05); TNF-α level in OSAHS group and the T2DM group are higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05), but there was no difference in TNF-α level between the OSAHS group and the T2DM group. There was also no difference in ET level of the four groups. There were significant differences of TNF-α before and after treatment of CPAP or surgery in OSAHS group and OSAHS+T2DM group (P < 0.05). But there was no significant differences of ET before and after treatment of CPAP or surgery in the OSAHS+T2DM group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: TNF-α may be involved in the development of OSAHS and T2DM, while ET may have little effect on the occurrence and development of OSAHS and T2DM.

%X OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of CPAP therapy on sleep quality and quality of life in patients with moderate or severe OSAHS. METHOD: Seventy-two patients diagnosed as OSAHS by polysomnography (PSG) were assigned to receive CPAP therapy for 3 months. At baseline and three months after treatment patients underwent polysomnography (PSG). Analyze the results of PSG, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life and the general well-being. RESULT: The lowest average oxygen saturation and the average blood oxygen saturation improved significantly after CPAP therapy, and the longest sleep apnea time and AHI decreased obviously (P < 0.01). Except body pain, the other seven dimensions of SF-36 improved obviously (P < 0.01); ESS, PSQI and GWB also improved (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with moderate or severe OSAHS, CPAP therapy can obviously improve the sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, improve patients' life quality and the general well-being.
